                <h3>Prospective Visitors</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>I would like to visit your Office.</strong>
                        You are always most welcome to visit my office. My office is located in SEECS-NUST. For more
                        information, feel free to<a href="contact.html"> contact me</a>
                        <p>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>I would like give a talk in your HPC lab.</strong>
                        Unless you have been already invited, the answer is usually negative. Please understand that I
                        are already in the habit of inviting a good number of researchers every month, to present
                        exciting work. We simply don't have the time for more presentations.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Prospective Students, Postdocs And Staff</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enclosed is my Curriculum Vita.</strong> (those Emails often come with: hire me, admit
                        me, I want to leave my country, I want to work with you...). Please be aware that I have
                        received many hundreds of those messages, but I never hired or admitted a person whom I didn't
                        know personally or who didn't come with very strong recommendations from leading researchers in
                        the field. Because of the huge volume of requests, I may not read CVs that are sent to me
                        without solicitation.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>How can I become a student at your esteemed
                            university?</strong> Every Spring, Stanford admits a small number of
                        students into its various educational programs. A good starting point
                        is the <a href="https://ugadmissions.nust.edu.pk/">Admissions page</a>,
                        which contains guidelines for admission and descriptions of the
                        various programs. You might want to know that none of NUST's
                        educational programs solicit direct interaction with NUST faculty,
                        staff, or students, during the process of applying. In particular, sending me a CV does not
                        increase the prospects of getting admitted. I don't admit students, the University and the
                        Department does.

                <h3>Stanford Students</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>I am looking for an academic adviser.</strong> Great! Feel free to <a
                            href="contact.html">contact me</a> directly,
                        though I strongly recommend contacting my students first if you are interesting in working with
                        them on one of their projects.<p>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>I am looking for financial support.</strong> This is usually not a problem if you work
                        with me or one of my students/postdocs, but I cannot charge your stipend or tuition to one of my
                        research grants if you are not working with one of us.<p>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>I'd like you to write me a letter.</strong> I am usually happy to, with one caveat: If I
                        barely know you, then I will state this in my letter. Sending me your CV doesn't really change
                        this; neither does an office visit. Please consider that it can look quite negative if one of
                        your chosen supporter barely knows you. So be careful that you select only recommenders who know
                        you well. I believe this applies to pretty much any faculty recommender at NUST.<p>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Thanks for reading my FAQ. I appreciate the interaction with people all over the world, but hope that
                    some of the most urgent questions will find an answer on this FAQ.
